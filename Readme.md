## 1.  _6174 does KAPREKAR'S Constant 
Kaprekar constant, or 6174, is a constant that arises when we take a 4-digit integer, form the largest and smallest numbers from its digits, and then subtract these two numbers. Continuing with this process of forming and subtracting, we will always arrive at the number 6174. [!link](https://brilliant.org/wiki/kaprekars-constant/)
It does this by
1. Taking 4 digit numbers 
2. Checking no same digit is availabe and the input int hsa 4 digit
3. Sort the int
4. Substaract the biggest sort to the smallest sort until it gets 6174
